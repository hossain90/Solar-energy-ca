  dailyConsumption: `Your average daily electricity consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh). Check your electricity bill for this information or use our consumption calculator.`,

  systemSize: `The total power output capacity of your solar system in kilowatts (kW). This is calculated based on your consumption, location's solar irradiance, and system efficiency.`,

  panelEfficiency: `Solar panel efficiency indicates how much sunlight is converted into electricity. Modern panels typically range from 15% to 25% efficiency. Higher efficiency means fewer panels needed but may cost more.`,

  batteryBackup: `Battery backup systems store excess solar energy for use during nighttime or cloudy days. This increases system cost but provides energy independence and backup power during outages.`,

  autonomyDays: `The number of days your battery system can power your home without solar input. More autonomy days means larger battery capacity and higher cost.`,

  tiltAngle: `The angle between your solar panels and the horizontal surface. Optimal tilt depends on your latitude and typically equals your latitude minus 10-15 degrees.`,

  azimuthAngle: `The compass direction your panels face. In the Northern Hemisphere, south-facing (180°) is typically optimal. East (90°) or west (270°) facing panels produce about 15-20% less energy.`,

  shadingFactor: `Reduction in solar production due to shadows from trees, buildings, or other obstacles. Even partial shade can significantly impact system performance.`,

  annualSavings: `Estimated yearly savings on your electricity bill based on your current electricity rates and projected solar production, accounting for seasonal variations.`,

  paybackPeriod: `The time required for energy savings to equal the initial system cost. This calculation includes installation costs, tax incentives, and projected energy prices.`,

  monthlyProduction: `Expected solar energy production for each month, accounting for seasonal sun position changes, weather patterns, and panel configuration.`,

  temperatureEffect: `Solar panel efficiency decreases as temperature rises. Typical efficiency loss is about 0.4% per degree Celsius above 25°C (77°F).`,

  systemEfficiency: `Overall system efficiency including panel efficiency, inverter losses, wiring losses, and other system components. Modern systems typically achieve 75-85% total efficiency.`,

  costBreakdown: `Detailed breakdown of system costs including panels, inverter, mounting hardware, batteries (if applicable), installation labor, and permits.`,

  gridConnection: `Type of connection to the electrical grid. Grid-tied systems can send excess power to the grid for credits, while off-grid systems require battery storage.`,

  maintenanceCost: `Annual maintenance costs including cleaning, inspections, and potential repairs. Typically 1-2% of initial system cost per year.`,

  incentives: `Available tax credits, rebates, and other incentives that reduce your initial system cost. These vary by location and may have expiration dates.`,

  environmentalImpact: `Environmental benefits of your solar system including CO2 emissions reduction, equivalent trees planted, and carbon footprint reduction.`
